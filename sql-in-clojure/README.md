Simple SQL interpreter in Clojure
=================================

##How to use
Just drag the interpreter into LightTable  
cmd + a --> cmd + enter  
Thatâ€™s it.  

##Example
(select [:id :name] from persons  
        where :id in #{{:id 1} {:id 3}}  
        orderby :id)  
  
(select [:car] from cars  
         where :id in (select [:id] from persons  
                        where :name like "h"  
                        orderby :id)  
         orderby :id)
